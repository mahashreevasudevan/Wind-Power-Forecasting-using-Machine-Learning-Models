# Wind Power Forecasting using Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN)

This project uses Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) for forecasting wind power based solely on wind speed. KANs are built on the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem, which says that any multivariate function can be represented as a composition of univariate functions. That makes them ideal for approximating complex trends even in low-dimensional spaces.

Here, we apply a KAN model to univariate time series data. The goal is to capture the nonlinear mapping between wind speed and power output using a feedforward structure based on the Kolmogorov approach.

## Key Objectives:

- Forecast wind power using wind speed  
- Build and train a Kolmogorov–Arnold Network from scratch using TensorFlow  
- Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and MSE  
- Interpret the model's predictions using SHAP  
- Understand how far a univariate KAN can go in a real-world energy scenario
